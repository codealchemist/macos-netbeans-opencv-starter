macos-netbeans-opencv-starter
=============================

MacOS NetBeans OpenCV starter project.

Install opencv using Mac Ports:
``` bash
port install opencv
```

Install required tools:
``` bash
port install cmake pkgconfig
```

I've created this repo after fighting for some time with this initial setup.
This is running on MacOS 10.7.5, NetBeans 7.3 and OpenCV 2.4.5.
I hope it can make it easier for you!
:)
